# ReactNativeProject2
As a begineer in react native, I learned more about styling. Created different cards to understand more about react native components.
I made a simple card which have 3 boxes evenly spread in the row. Then i made a horizontally scrollable card with multiple boxes in it.
After that i made a card which can load image and styled it , learned about TouchableOpacity for click actions. Then Load views dynamically from a list.<img width="353" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-06 at 2 00 03 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118592984/236612937-b131e216-1775-49a3-9da6-aff4c01108db.png">
